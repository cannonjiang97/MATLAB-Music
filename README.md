# MATLAB-Music
Use the function sound() to create music.

The files with capitalized letters are the main music programs.
I've uploaded 3 test songs:君は蔷薇より美しい, 北京的金山上 and 一剪梅.
You could use these models to create your music.

The files with uncapitalized letters are the sub-programs.
All sounds are generated by the function snd(tone,pitch,rythm,fs) in snd.m.
  Tones: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 represent C,D,E,F,G,A,B in music;
         8 for stop
  Pitch: 0 for base, 1,2,3... for higher tone, and -1,-2,-3... for lower tones ; 
  rythm: 1 for base, bigger the number, longer the rythm.
  fs: Sampling frequency. Commonly 8192 Hz.
         
For convenience, I created a tone library in tone.m.
All tones are in this sequence: tone + pitch + rythm.
  Tones: d,r,m,f,s,l,c represent C,D,E,F,G,A,B in music,
         x for stop;
  Pitch: 'h' for Higher tones, 'l' for lower tones; 
  rythm: '1' for 2 times longer rythm, '11' for 4 times longer rythm,
         '0' for 2 times shorter rythm, '00' for 4 times shorter rythm;
E.g.  'dh1' for C in higher tone  for longer rythm;
      'll0' for A in lower tone for shorter rythm;
       'm' for E in base tone for base rythm.
